<p>From 2014-2021, Code For Greenville members built and maintained the technology which allowed thousands of locals and visitors to track the downtown Greenville trolleys in real-time from their mobile devices.<p>

<p>As of June 30, 2023, <a href="https://codeforamerica.org/news/reflections-on-the-brigade-networks-next-chapter/">Code For America officially withdrew fiscal sponsorship and use of the "Code For" trademark to <strong>all</strong> national brigades</a>, including Code For Greenville.</p>
